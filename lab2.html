        <p>In this laboratory you are going to detect motion activities such as walking, running, jumping, resting, etc. using the accelerometer of the Movesense.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Record all the activities you want to detect multiple times (for example 5 times), with the same duration, for example of 10 secondes.</li>
          <li>Put each activities in a different folder. For example a
        folder <i>run</i> containing all the records taken when
        running, and so on.</li>
          <li>Load the data by activity.</li>
          <li>Visualize the data.</li>
          <li>Find a way to detect the activities. That is, try to
        identify a feature that characterizes a given activity and
        allows you to differentiate it from the others. For example,
        you may compute the standard deviation of the data
        corresponding to the activities. Don't hesitate to try more complex features if needed.</li>
        </ul>

        We provide you with a notebook with an example code to load and visualize the data.

        <strong>virtualenv:</strong> Prepare a virtual environment
        with all the Python tools needed, and listed in the following file:</li>
        <a href="requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a>

        <pre>
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
        </pre>

        <strong>Notebook:</strong> The notebook from this folder contains an example to read the data and the beginning of the practical work, you can start it using:

        <pre>
$ jupyter lab
	</pre>
	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>What characteristics of the MoseSense sensor are important to know
	  when performing a recording ? What are the "by default"
	  settings you are using right now ?
	  <li>How noisy is the data captured by the MoveSense sensor ?
	  <li>How variable are the recordings you made for a given
	  activity ? How variable is the feature you computed to
	  characterize a given activity ?
	  <li>Is it always possible to differentiate various
	  activities by computing a feature of the corresponding data
	  ? If not, why not combining multiple features (e.g., median,
	  range, standard deviation) and defining a rule (or a set of rules) based on them ?
	  <li>What other features can be computed to characterize a
	  set of measurements like the ones captured using the
	  MoveSense during a particular activity ?
	  <li>For a cyclic activity like walking, can you identify a periodic
	  pattern in the data ?
	  <li>Did you observe that the sensor has to be worn in the
	  same way during an experiment ? (e.g., you cannot turn it
	  upside down for instance ?) why ? by the way, did you notice
	  the sensing of the acceleration caused by gravity and how it
	  perturbs your data ?
	  </ul>
